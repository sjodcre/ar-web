UCM BazAR is a **decentralized compute platform** built on **Arweave** that enables **massively parallel computations**.  
Unlike **traditional cloud computing**, UCM BazAR provides:
- **Scalability without limits**
- **No central point of failure**
- **True decentralized hosting of applications**

## **🔹 Core Components of UCM BazAR**
### **1️⃣ Scheduler Units (SUs)**
- Task managers that assign jobs to computing nodes.
- Ensure efficient distribution of processing power.

### **2️⃣ Compute Units (CUs)**
- Execute computing tasks.
- Return results securely.

### **3️⃣ Messenger Units (MUs)**
- Handle communication between different processes.
- Ensure seamless coordination between computing nodes.

## **🔹 Benefits of UCM BazAR**
✅ **Infinite scalability** → Computation scales as demand grows.  
✅ **Permanent storage** → All computations & results are stored immutably.  
✅ **Fully decentralized** → No central authority controls the system.  

## **🔹 Real-World Applications**
