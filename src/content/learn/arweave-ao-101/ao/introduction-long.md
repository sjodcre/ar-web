AO is a **decentralized compute platform** built on Arweave that introduces a **revolutionary way to process and execute computations at scale**.

Unlike traditional **cloud or blockchain systems**, which have **limited processing power**, AO uses **hyper-parallel computing**, allowing **unlimited simultaneous tasks**.

## **Core Architecture**
AO consists of **three main components**:

### **1. Scheduler Units (SUs)**
- Manage and assign tasks dynamically.
- Ensure computations are efficiently distributed.

### **2. Compute Units (CUs)**
- Execute tasks **in parallel**.
- Support complex applications such as **AI models, validator nodes, and dApps**.

### **3. Messenger Units (MUs)**
- Handle **asynchronous message passing** between processes.
- Enable **scalable and decentralized communication**.

## **Why AO Matters**
AO enables **fully decentralized computation** that:
- **Scales infinitely** based on demand.
- **Runs efficiently without centralized control**.
- **Integrates with Arweave for permanent data storage**.

## **Use Cases**
AO is particularly well-suited for:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** → Train and run AI models in a decentralized environment.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** → Supports on-chain validation and smart contract execution.
- **Onchain Applications** → Enables **high-performance decentralized apps**.
