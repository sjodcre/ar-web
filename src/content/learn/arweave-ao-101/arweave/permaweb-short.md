The **permaweb** is a **permanent, decentralized web** built on Arweave. It **eliminates broken links and missing content**, ensuring that data and applications remain **permanently accessible**.

Beyond simple **file storage**, the permaweb hosts **full-fledged decentralized applications** that:
- **Run autonomously**
- **Are immutable (cannot be changed)**
- **Require no ongoing maintenance from developers**

## **Key Technologies**
- **Gateways** → Provide access to stored data.
- **GraphQL APIs** → Enable efficient querying.
