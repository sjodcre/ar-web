# ðŸš€ Quick App Development and Deployment with Arweave & AO

## 1. Integrating AO's Messaging Unit into Your Application

If you plan to deploy your application on platforms like Vercel or others, minimal configuration changes are needed. The primary adjustment involves integrating AO's Messaging Unit, which serves as both middleware and backend, with the database managed within AO.

### 1.1 Installing Necessary Packages

To communicate with AO's Messaging Unit, you'll need the `@permaweb/aoconnect` package. Install it using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @permaweb/aoconnect

# Using yarn
yarn add @permaweb/aoconnect
```

### 1.2 Sending a Dry-Run Message to AO's Messaging Unit

A dry-run allows you to send a message to an AO process without requiring a wallet signature, making it ideal for testing purposes.

```javascript
import { dryrun } from '@permaweb/aoconnect';

async function sendDryRunMessage() {
  const result = await dryrun({
    process: 'PROCESS_ID', // Replace with your AO process ID
    data: '', // Message payload
    tags: [{ name: 'Action', value: 'Balance' }], // Example tag
    anchor: '1234', // Optional anchor
    // Additional optional fields: Id, Owner, etc.
  });

  console.log(result.Messages[0]);
}

sendDryRunMessage();
```

In this example:

- **process**: The unique identifier of the AO process you're targeting.
- **data**: The message content or payload.
- **tags**: Metadata associated with the message.
- **anchor**: An optional field for anchoring the message.

For more details, refer to the [AO Messaging Guide](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/begin/messaging.html).

## 2. Deploying Your dApp onto Arweave

To deploy your dApp on Arweave, specific configurations are necessary, especially concerning the routing system.

### 2.1 Configuring Next.js for Arweave Deployment

When deploying a Next.js application to Arweave, consider the following adjustments:

1. **Export the Application as Static HTML**: Arweave serves static content, so you'll need to export your Next.js app accordingly.

2. **Update `next.config.js`**: Ensure your configuration supports static exports.

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA)
  distDir: './out', // Output directory
};
```

3. **Build and Export**:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```

This process generates static files in the `out` directory, ready for deployment on Arweave.

For a practical example, refer to the [Arweave Next.js Template](https://arweave-nextjs.arweave.dev/).

### 2.2 Configuring Vite for Arweave Deployment

For Vite applications, the following configurations are recommended:

1. **Update `vite.config.js`**: Adjust the base path to ensure correct asset loading.

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '', // Ensures relative paths
});
```

2. **Modify `package.json`**: Add a deploy script using Bundlr for deployment.

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "deploy": "yarn build && bundlr upload-dir dist --index-file index.html"
  }
}
```

3. **Deploy Using Bundlr**:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This script builds your application and uploads the `dist` directory to Arweave using Bundlr.
