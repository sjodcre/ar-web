# Understanding Handlers in AO Lua Processes

In the Actor-Oriented (AO) computing paradigm on the Arweave network, `handlers` are essential constructs that define how processes respond to incoming messages. They enable AO processes to manage and execute logic based on pattern matching, facilitating responsive and autonomous decentralized programs.
