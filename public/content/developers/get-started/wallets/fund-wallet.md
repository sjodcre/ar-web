# üí∞ Funding Your Wander Wallet

To interact with the Arweave and AO ecosystems using your **Wander Wallet**, you'll need to acquire **AR** tokens. If you are only looking to deploy applications, AR tokens are enough (for now). However, if you wish to utilize more features, you may need to convert them into **AO-compatible tokens**.

## Understanding AR and Its Role in the AO Ecosystem

**AR** is the native token of the Arweave network, used primarily for permanent data storage.  
However, to utilize AR within the AO ecosystem, it must be converted into AO-compatible tokens such as **wAR** (wrapped AR) or **qAR** (Quantum-wrapped AR).  
This conversion allows you to interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and services within AO.

## Steps to Acquire and Utilize AR in the AO Ecosystem

### 1. Obtain AR Tokens

**Purchase via Centralized Exchanges (CEX):**

### 2. Convert AR to AO-Compatible Tokens

Once your Wander Wallet holds `AR`, convert it to `wAR` or `qAR` to participate in the AO ecosystem.
