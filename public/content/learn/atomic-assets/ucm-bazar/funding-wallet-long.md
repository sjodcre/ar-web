UCM BazAR operates on Arweave and AO — two powerful decentralized networks that require wallet funding with AR tokens to enable storage and transactions.

## 🔹 Step-by-Step: How to Fund Your Wallet

### 1️⃣ Acquire AR Tokens
You can obtain AR tokens from centralized exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, or Gate.io. These tokens are the native currency of the Arweave network and are required to store content or execute transactions.

### 2️⃣ Transfer AR to Your Wallet
After purchase, transfer the AR tokens to your personal wallet. You can use a compatible wallet such as **ArConnect** or **Wander Wallet**. Once in your wallet, you're ready to use UCM BazAR.

### 3️⃣ Convert AR to AO-Compatible Format
To use your AR in the AO ecosystem (where on-chain computation happens), it must be converted into AO-compatible tokens like **wAR** (wrapped AR) or **qAR** (quantum AR).

You can learn more about how this conversion works — including how to use bridges like AOX or Astro — in the **[Funding Guide](./developers/get-started/wallets/fund-wallet)**.

## 🔹 Why This Matters
- 🧠 **Compute & Interact**: AR funds storage on Arweave, but wAR/qAR unlock your ability to run bots, agents, or services in AO.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Usage**: Computation costs and usage fees are deducted in real time as you interact with dApps in UCM BazAR.

> 💡 Think of AR as the raw fuel — but to power advanced features like AO computations, you need the right form of that fuel.
