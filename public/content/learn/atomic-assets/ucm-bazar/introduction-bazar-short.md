description: "Learn how UCM BazAR enables fully decentralized, permanent, and programmable digital assets using Arweave and AO."
---

**UCM BazAR** is a fully decentralized marketplace for **atomic assets** â€” digital items stored entirely on-chain via Arweave. Built on top of the **Universal Content Marketplace (UCM)** protocol, it ensures content is immutable, tradeable, and censorship-resistant.

## ðŸ”¹ What Sets BazAR Apart?

- **Permanent Storage**: Assets are forever accessible on Arweave.
- **Fractional Ownership**: Assets can be split and owned by many.
- **On-Chain Licensing**: Define how your assets are used via UDL.
- **Powered by AO**: Fast, scalable compute through decentralized processes.

## ðŸ”¹ Create & Trade

1. **Connect your wallet** (e.g. ArConnect).
2. **Upload your content** and set metadata.
3. **Trade or fractionalize** with ease.

To fund your wallet and convert AR to AO-compatible tokens, check the [Funding Guide](./developers/get-started/wallets/fund-wallet).

## ðŸ”¹ Why It Matters

UCM BazAR gives creators full control over their content and lets collectors invest in digital culture â€” all without platforms in the middle.
