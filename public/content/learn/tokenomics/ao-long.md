AO Computer is a **decentralized supercomputing platform** powered by the **AO token**, facilitating **secure, incentive-driven computations**.

## ðŸ”¹ Token Supply & Minting
- **Total Supply**: **21 million AO tokens** (Bitcoin-like scarcity model).
- **Minting Mechanism**:
  - **New tokens every 5 minutes**.
  - **1.425% monthly reduction** in minted supply.
  - **4-year halving cycle**, reducing new supply over time.

2. **64%** â†’ Incentivizes **bridging assets into AO** to promote ecosystem growth.

## ðŸ”¹ Economic Model
- **Incentivizing Computation** â†’ AO rewards participants who contribute computing resources.
- **Developer Incentives** â†’ Applications attracting users/assets earn AO, fostering development.

## ðŸ”¹ Token Lock-Up Period
- **AO is non-transferable** until **15% of total supply is minted** (~February 2025).
