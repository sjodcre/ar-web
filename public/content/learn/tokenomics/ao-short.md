AO Computer is a **decentralized supercomputing platform** built on Arweave, featuring the **AO token** to facilitate computational tasks.

## ðŸ”¹ Token Supply & Distribution
- **Total Supply**: Fixed at **21 million tokens** (mirroring Bitcoin).
- **Fair Launch**: No presales or pre-mining, ensuring equitable distribution.
- **Minting**: New AO tokens are minted every **five minutes**, with a **1.425% monthly reduction**, following a **4-year halving cycle**.

- **36%** â†’ Allocated to **Arweave (AR) token holders**.
- **64%** â†’ Incentivizing **bridging of external assets** into AO.

## ðŸ”¹ Economic Model
- **Computational Rewards**: AO tokens compensate providers of computing power.
- **Ecosystem Funding**: Developers who attract users/assets earn AO tokens.

## ðŸ”¹ Token Lock-Up Period
- **Non-transferable** until **15% of the supply is minted** (~February 2025).
