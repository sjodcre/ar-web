AO achieves **infinite scalability** by executing tasks **in parallel**.

## **Key Scalability Innovations**
- **Modular, on-demand computation** → No shared global state.
- **Recursive Message Processing** → Ensures high throughput.
- **Dynamic Compute Expansion** → More Compute Units (CUs) can be added as needed.

This makes AO **ideal for Web3, AI, and high-performance onchain applications**.
