title: "Core Architecture of AO: Message-Passing and Scalability"
description: "Explore the message-passing model of AO, which enables Processes to execute code without shared state, featuring key components that facilitate infinite scalability for decentralized applications."

AO’s **message-passing model** allows Processes to execute code **without requiring shared state**.

## **Key Components**
- **Messenger Units (MUs)** → Handle message routing.
- **Scheduler Units (SUs)** → Order and store messages on Arweave.
- **Compute Units (CUs)** → Execute computational tasks.

By leveraging these components, AO can **scale infinitely**, making it ideal for **onchain applications, AI, and decentralized computing**.
