# Introduction to Arweave: The Future of Permanent Data Storage

Arweave is a new kind of storage system where **you pay once and your data stays online forever**. Unlike traditional cloud storage that might delete or change your files, Arweave keeps them safe and unchanged — permanently.

## How Arweave Works

It uses something called a **blockweave** — like a blockchain but smarter. Each new block connects not just to the one before it, but also to a random older one. This helps keep copies of your data spread out and safe.

## Pay Once, Keep Forever

When you upload to Arweave:

- You pay just once using AR tokens.
- That money goes into a fund that keeps paying storage costs forever.
- You never have to pay again — ever.

## Built for the Future

Developers are building:

- dApps (decentralized apps)
- Easy gateways to access data
- GraphQL APIs to search information
