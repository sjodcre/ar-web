# Arweave: One-Time Payment for Lifelong Storage

Arweave is a **permaweb protocol** offering decentralized, tamper-proof data storage. It introduces a sustainable economic model where **users pay once**, and data remains available indefinitely.

## Blockweave Architecture

Unlike linear blockchains:

- Arweaveâ€™s blockweave links each block to a previous + random old block.
- This supports **Proof of Access**, ensuring redundancy and fast retrieval.

## Sustainable Storage Economy

The one-time AR token fee:

- Part goes into a **storage endowment**.
- Miners are incentivized to keep your data available forever.

## Developer Ecosystem

Dev tools include:

- dApps
- Gateways
- GraphQL interfaces for efficient querying
