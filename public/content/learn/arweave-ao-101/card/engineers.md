# Arweave: Immutable Decentralized Storage at Scale

Arweave introduces a novel **blockweave data structure**, supporting permanent data archiving with a unique **"pay once, store forever"** model.

## Core Architecture: Blockweave + PoA

- Combines previous-block linking with randomly selected back references.
- Enables **Proof of Access (PoA)**: miners must retrieve old data to produce new blocks.
- Enhances decentralization and access redundancy.

## Tokenomics: Perpetual Storage Incentives

- One-time AR fee per upload.
- Portion allocated to **endowment fund** that yields miner incentives.
- No recurring costs — data availability is perpetuated via yield mechanisms.

## Tooling for Builders

- Native support for dApps, GraphQL, and content gateways.
- Encourages verifiable, persistent application backends.
