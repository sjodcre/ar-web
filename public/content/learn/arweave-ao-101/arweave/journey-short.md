# Arweave Upgrades (Up to v2.6)

> This is a quick summary of Arweaveâ€™s protocol evolution from its launch up to version **2.6**.

## ðŸ“Œ What Is Arweave?

A decentralized network for **permanent data storage**, designed to store large, immutable files forever. Instead of traditional Proof of Work, it uses a unique mechanism called **Proof of Access** (PoA), which rewards miners for storing and accessing historical data.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Proof of Access (PoA)**: Miners must retrieve and prove access to past blocks before mining.
- **RandomX (v1.7)**: Prevented GPU/ASIC mining by enforcing CPU-bound hashing.
- **Succinct Proofs (v2.0)**: Compressed Merkle proofs replaced full recall blocks, improving scalability.
- **Format 2 Transactions**: Allowed header/data separation and larger uploads.
- **Bundles (v2.4)**: One transaction can include 1000s of others, breaking the 1000 tx/block cap.
- **Spora + Cryptographic Clock (v2.6)**: Introduced a verifiable speed limit on hashing; mining now rewards storage over compute.
