The **permaweb** is a revolutionary concept **built on top of Arweave**, creating a **decentralized and immutable web**. 

Unlike the **traditional internet**, which is **vulnerable to data loss**, the permaweb ensures that once information is uploaded, it **is stored forever**.

## **Why Is This Important?**
- The traditional web relies on **centralized servers**, meaning data can be **lost if a server shuts down**.
- The permaweb distributes content **across a global network of nodes**.
- This ensures applications **remain available forever**.

## **What Can Be Built on the Permaweb?**
Beyond static files, developers can create **full-fledged decentralized applications (dApps)** that:
- **Are immutable** (cannot be altered).
- **Run independently** without requiring maintenance.
- **Operate without centralized oversight**.

## **Key Technologies**
- **Gateways** → Act as access points for retrieving and displaying stored data.
- **GraphQL APIs** → Enable users to efficiently query stored data.
- **SmartWeave** → Arweave’s **smart contract** system.
- **Profit-Sharing Communities (PSCs)** → Allow developers to distribute revenue and governance to users.
