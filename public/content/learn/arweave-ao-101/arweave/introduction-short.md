Arweave is a decentralized protocol designed for **permanent data storage**, allowing users to preserve information indefinitely with a single, one-time fee. 

Secured by a network of **miners rewarded with AR tokens**, Arweave ensures data is replicated and remains accessible through a **sustainable endowment model**. 

This approach supports the **permaweb**â€”a collection of permanent web pages and applications **free from centralized control**, fostering a space where **history and culture are preserved**, and **free speech is upheld**. 

Developers are empowered to create **fully decentralized applications** on the permaweb, contributing to a more **resilient and open internet**.
