title: "Scalability Innovations in Arweave"
description: "Discover how Arweave achieves scalability through innovative techniques like transaction bundling, blockweave structure, and recursive bundling, ensuring efficient and permanent data storage."

Arweave achieves **scalability** through several key innovations:

- **Transaction bundling** → Multiple transactions are combined into a single block, improving efficiency.
- **Blockweave structure** → Uses a **Proof of Access (PoA) consensus** to ensure redundancy.
- **Recursive bundling** → Transactions can be **bundled within bundles**, enabling **theoretical infinite scalability**.

These innovations make Arweave a **robust solution for decentralized, permanent data storage**.
